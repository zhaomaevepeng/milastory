  <h4 id="subhead"><em>For many, food is a way of life. Not only as a means to survive, but as a cultural and social staple. Recipes are passed down from generation to generation, families and friends gather over meals and potlucks, and people can share their rich culture by sharing traditional foods. </em></h4>

<h4 id="subhead"><em>It can be easy to forget, however, that many are not able to partake in these traditions as they frequently wonder where their next meal will come from. Due to inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic, this issue has only worsened over the years, with some demographics suffering more than others. </em></h4>

    
 <h4 id="subhead"> <em>Lack of access to nutritious foods or any food at all can have longterm consequences, making it imperative that this issue is dealt with swiftly and comprehensively.

      <p style="margin-top: -550px;"><strong> What Is Food Insecurity? </strong> </p>
      
      <h3> The <a href=https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/definitions-of-food-security/U.S. style="color: dodgerblue;"> Department of Agriculture </a>, or USDA, defines food insecurity as households or individuals having “multiple indications of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake,” and are experiencing a “ household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food.” In simple terms, people experiencing food insecurity struggle to regularly attain desired food and often wonder where their next meal will come from.
      </h3>
   
  <h3> The USDA specifies that food insecurity is different from hunger. Food insecurity describes the lack of accessibility to food due to economic or social standing, while hunger is an “individual-level physiological” condition caused by not eating. Hunger is a frequent result of food insecurity, but the terms are not interchangeable. 
  </h3>

      
      <h3> Food insecurity exists on a spectrum. <a href=https://www.fao.org/hunger/en style="color:dodgerblue"> The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States</a>, or FOA, developed a scale used to specify the severity of insecurity. A person who is food secure or has mild insecurity may face “uncertainty regarding ability to obtain food,” with the most severe cases causing someone to go without food for a day or more. </h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who Is The Most At Risk? </h2>
  
    <p>Due to the inherent social and financial determinants of food insecurity, the issue is prevalent in some demographics more than others.</p>
<p>Economic standing is the most obvious determinant, with the USDA reporting in 2022 that 36.7% of U.S. households who make below the poverty line are food insecure. Erin McAleer, CEO of the nonprofit <a href=https://projectbread.org/about-us style="color: dodgerblue;">Project Bread</a>, reports that 15.4% of households in Massachusetts are food insecure as of January 2024. This rate increases to 19.2% for households with children. 
</p>
<p>Another group at great risk for food insecurity and poverty are people of color, specifically black and latinx households. According to <a href=https://www.bluecrossmafoundation.org/sites/g/files/csphws2101/files/2021-12/Health_Equity_Primer_Dec%202021_final_0.pdf style="color: dodgerblue;">The Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation</a>, 15% of white households in Massachusetts made less than $29,435 a year, compared to 33% for black households and 37% for latinx households. They also report that while only 7% white people in Massachusetts use food stamps, that rate is 25% for black people and 28% for hispanic people.</p>

<p><a style="color: dodgerblue;" href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/black-communities#:~:text=Low%20wages%20and%20unemployment,to%20afford%20enough%20healthy%20food.">Feeding America</a> explains that racism and discrimination affects access to resources and opportunities. In turn, people of color have less access to high-paying jobs which can result in a low income. People of color are also more likely to live in food deserts, which Feeding America describes as “areas without grocery stores or other places to buy fresh, healthy foods.”
  </p> 

  <p>This is not an exhaustive list, as food insecurity affects all vulnerable populations. McAleer says this list includes, “low-wage workers, immigrants, non-English speakers, people who are housing insecure or experiencing homelessness, people with disabilities… and people who were previously incarcerated.”</p>
    <p>The Boston areas that face the most food insecurity are Mattapan, Dorchester, East Boston, Roslindale, and Roxbury, <a href=https://www.boston.com/community/neighborhoods/guide-to-food-access-in-mattapan/#:~:text=The%20Boston%20neighborhoods%20with%20the,was%20added%20to%20that%20list.>Boston.com</a> reports.

<p><strong> Why Are Food Insecurity Rates Rising? </strong></p>  
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: -20px; font-size: 15px;"> COVID-19’s effects were felt in every aspect of human life. Economically, the pandemic destroyed many. According to <a href=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html style="color: dodgerblue;">U.S. Census data</a>, the percentage of Massachusetts households that were food insecure pre-pandemic was 8.2%. This rate quickly shot up to 19.6% by May of 2020.</p>  </p> 
<h3 style="margin-top: -375px; font-size:  15px;">“When the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the public health emergency caused communities to close, unemployment to soar, and, for many, anxiety about paying for and accessing enough food to mount,” <a href=https://www.feedingamerica.org/research/coronavirus-hunger-research style="color: dodgerblue;"> Feeding America</a> wrote.
</h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 15px">Food prices have risen due to inflation, making food less accessible to those who lost their source of income during COVID-19. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a tool used to measure inflation and price changes, has increased every year since 2015, except in 2016. </h3>
<iframe title="Annual Percent Change In Consumer Price Index (CPI)" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-nC550" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nC550/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="443" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
<h3 style="font-size: 15px;">The rate of food insecurity began to lower again after the lockdown was lifted, falling to 10.7% in April of 2021. That is the lowest rate we have seen post-COVID, as the rate continued to fluctuate between 10.7% and 20% in the following years.</h3>
  <h3 style="font-size: 15px;"> Even fast food, which many low-income individuals rely on due to convenience and low costs, has seen significant price increases over the years. <a href=https://fox59.com/news/national-world/prices-at-these-fast-food-chains-increased-the-most-in-10-years style="color: dodgerblue;">Fox 59</a> reports that a McDonald's quarterpounder with cheese meal cost $5.39 in 2014 and $11.99 in 2024, a 122% increase. The Popeyes four-piece chicken dinner has increased by 94%, costing $6.99 in 2014 and $13.79 in 2024.</h3>
<h3 style="font-size: 15px;">While food prices are not expected to decrease in 2024, the <a style="color: dodgerblue;" href=https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings>USDA predicts</a> that they will rise at a much slower rate than we have seen in the past few years. </h3>

    <h2>What Are The Consequences Of Food Insecurity? </h2>

    <h5>Food insecurity can have long term effects, especially for children. A 2015 study published in <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0645#:~:text-This%20research%20has%20found%20that,9%20and%20aggression%20and%20anxiety." style="color: dodgerblue;">Health Affairs</a> says that food insecure children are “at least twice as likely to report being in fair or poor health and at least 1.4 times more likely to have asthma, compared to food-secure children.”
    </h5>
    <h5>Not having access to food can lead to nutritional deficiencies and malnurishment that can cause life long ailments. Nutritional expert Colleen Spees told <a href=https://www.heart.org/en/news/2021/09/22/food-insecuritys-long-term-health-consequences style="color: dodgerblue;">The American Heart Association</a> that these deficiencies can lead to multiple chronic illnesses. “When you're not getting adequate nutrients to your brain and muscles and organs over time, we see the ill effects,” she said.
    </h5> 
  <h5>As mentioned previously, fast food and unhealthy foods are often the cheapest. In food deserts, which are predominantly low-income neighborhoods, unhealthy food is the most accessible. While many food insecure people eat enough calories, the food they have access to can be harmful to their health, resulting in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other ailments.

      <p style="margin-top: -550px;"><strong> How To Create Widespread Change? </strong> </p>
      
      </p> 
      <h4 style="margin-top: -200px;">The most simple but challenging way to reduce food insecurity is to reduce poverty. In the midst of inflation and a global <a href=https://www.rescue.org/uk/article/what-cost-living-crisis-looks-around-world style="color: dodgerblue;">cost of living crisis</a>, we most likely won’t see this happen anytime soon. There are other policy changes that could see a decrease in food insecurity, however. 
      </h4>

      <h4>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is fundamental in the fight against food insecurity. It is the largest nutritional assistance program in the US. According to the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap/key-statistics-and-research/#:~:text-The%20Supplemental%20Nutrition%20Assistance%20Program,fiscal%20year%20(FY)%202022.&text=Download%20chart%20data%20in%20Excel,41.2%20million%20participants%20per%20month" style="color: dodgerblue;">USDA</a>, there was an average of 41.2 million participants in 2022. SNAP provides nine meals for every meal provided by a food bank, Project Bread found. 
      
      <h4>As helpful as SNAP is, it is in need of reform and modernization. <a style="color: dodgerblue" href="https://projectbread.org/research/barriers-to-snap style=">Project Bread</a> found that common barriers to people applying for SNAP include not being able to apply in a language other than English, not having computer access, fear of stigma, and believing that applying for SNAP can impact immigration status. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/more-adequate-snap-benefits-would-help-millions-of-participants-better" style="color: dodgerblue;">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>(CBPP) explains that families often struggle when SNAP benefits run out. Food and housing prices are higher in certain parts of the country, so the funds allotted by SNAP (which is determined by family size and monthly income) is sometimes not enough. 
      </h4>
      <h4>SNAP changes, even temporary ones, have already shown success in the past. Low-income households had higher food security when SNAP benefits were raised during the Great Recession, <a style="color: dodgerblue;" href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/modernizing-snap-benefits-would-help-millions-better-afford-healthy-food#:~:text=Larger%20SNAP%20benefits%20increase%20food,response%20to%20the%20Great%20Recession.">CBPP</a> says. Increasing SNAP benefits during the summer, when kids are not receiving free or discounted school lunch, has also been shown to decrease food insecurity.</h4>
      <h4>Project Bread lays out multiple permanent policy changes that can make SNAP more accessible, including passing a “federal law to increase income thresholds for eligibility for SNAP so that more food-insecure, working families can access benefits,” and “Permanently [amending] Massachusetts’ state law… to allow low-income households to apply for MassHealth/Medicare Savings Program and SNAP at the same time, and begin the process for creating a Common Application for all safety net programs.”</h4>
     <h4>Another effective policy change is making all school meals free, which takes some of the financial pressure off of parents and ensures that children are receiving nutritious foods. In 2023, Massachusetts became one of eight states offering universal free school meals. <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-joins-legislative-leadership-to-celebrate-permanent-universal-free-school-meals style=" style="color: dodgerblue;">Governor Healy</a> said, “By delivering universal free meals, this administration is making clear that nothing is more important than ensuring our kids are fed, healthy, and ready to learn and play and grow.” </h4>
     <h4> Implementing free lunches at schools nationwide could greatly aid those who are food insecure. <a style="color: dodgerblue;" href="https://frac.org/programs/national-school-lunch-program/benefits-school-lunch">The Food Research and Action Center</a> says that free or low-cost lunches can reduce food insecurity by at least 3.8%.</h4>
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 30px">McAleer says that Project Bread wants "change over charity," not only working to get immediate relief to families experiencing food insecurity, but “also working to identify and find solutions to the root causes of hunger in order to inform and develop long-term solutions to end hunger for good here in Massachusetts.” </h3>

 <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top: -200px;">How To Help Locally</h2>
 <h5 style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">While important, widespread policy changes can take time to enact. There are plenty of ways people can provide immediate aid to those in their community. 
 </h5>
 <h5 style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px"><a href=https://www.povertyusa.org/stories/what-causes-food-insecurity-and-what-are-solutions-it style="color: dodgerblue;">Poverty USA</a> recommends volunteering with and donating to local “food banks, co-ops, and mutual aid networks.” Feeding America has an <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank#:~:text=You%20can%20easily%20find%20a,free%20food%20and%20grocery%20items" style="color: dodgerblue;">online tool</a> where you can enter your zip code to find food banks in your area. 
 </h5>
 <h5 style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">To advocate for bills and programs that can help those experiencing food insecurity, you can write to congress or local representatives. <a href=https://www.bread.org/act/write-to-congress style="color: dodgerblue;">Bread For The World</a> has a comprehensive list of these bills and provides the information necessary to advocate for them. On the website, you can put in your information and it will assist you in communicating with the relevant elected officials. 
 </h5>
 <h5 style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">If you have the means, donating can also make a big difference. Feeding America has a <a href=https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-blog/what-donate-food-bank-and-what-avoid style="color: dodgerblue;">list of what foods</a> can and cannot be donated to food banks. Pasta, rice, canned soup, and canned vegetables are only some of the items regularly needed at food banks. There are also many relief organizations taking monetary donations. In Massachusetts, <a href="https://projectbread.org/individual-donations>Project Bread</a>, <a href=https://www.gbfb.org/ways-to-give" style="color: dodgerblue;">The Greater Boston Food Bank</a>, and <a href=https://thefoodproject.org/ways-to-give style="color: dodgerblue;">The Food Project</a>, are only some of the highly rated organizations you can donate to. 
 </h5>
 <h5 style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 250px">Finally, educating yourself on the landscape of food insecurity in your area can make you more mindful of how severe the issue is, who struggles the most, and where help is most needed. Gary Roy of The Greater Boston Food Bank recommends reading their annual report on food equity and access in Massachusetts, which presents a wide variety of information such as how many people use SNAP and food banks, the level of anxiety and depression food insecure people face, and what policy changes could help. You can read the 2023 report <a href=https://www.gbfb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ending-Hunger-Together_Opportunities-to-Improve-Food-Equity-and-Access.pdf style="color: dodgerblue;">here</a>, and their 2024 report will be released at the end of May. </h5>
